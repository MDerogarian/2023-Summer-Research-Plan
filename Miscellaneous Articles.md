Qiu, Weijie, et al. "A Grid Forming/Following Sequence Switching Control Strategy for Supporting Frequency Stability of Isolated Power Grids." 2023 5th Asia Energy and Electrical Engineering Symposium (AEEES). IEEE, 2023.

For an isolated power grid, due to the high penetration of renewable energy, the system inertia is low, and frequency instability is prone to occur after the power grid is disturbed.
