<br> The grid synchronization methods can be classified into two categories with respect to the operating modes of converter-based resources:
- The voltage-based grid synchronization that measures or estimates (voltage sensor-less) the frequency and phase of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of grid-connected converters. The detected phase is then used with the vector current control or the direct power control for regulating the active and reactive power exchanged with the grid. Such a voltage based grid synchronization control is named as the grid following control, since they follow the phase of grid voltage
- The power-based synchronization dictates directly the phase of the PCC voltage by regulating the active power of the converters [10], where the general idea is to utilize the active power-frequency (P-ω) droop control, which is widely used with synchronous generators, to synchronize converters with the grid [11]. To track the generated phase of the PCC voltage, the voltage control is required, which, thus, differs from grid-following converters. Such voltage-controlled converters are recently known as the grid-forming converters
<br> The synchronization stability of converter-based resources can be categorized into two types: small-signal stability and large-signal (transient) stability, similarly to the rotor angle stability of synchronous generators in legacy power systems
