<be>Virtual oscillator control (VOC) is an emerging control strategy for grid-forming inverters. In contrast with the droop and virtual synchronous generator methods, VOC is a nonlinear and time-domain strategy that requires only the inverter output current measurement to control the inverter output.

<be>The droop control technique, which mimics the operation of synchronous generators in power plants, is usually embedded into the control loop of inverters. It enables reliable operation (e.g. self-regulation of units’ output powers). However, the droop control technique inherently suffers from serious limitations related to the impedances of DG feeders. First, the conventional frequency–power droop control technique fails to achieve accurate power sharing among inverters [9]. It assumes pure inductive line impedance, whereas low voltage microgrids are mainly resistive with 𝑅∕𝑋 > 1. Furthermore, droop control has poor dynamic performance due to the use of lowpass filters in the control loop. Second, the voltage drop across feeder impedances located between the inverters and load bus will cause deviations in the microgrid voltage at the load terminal from its desired nominal value.

<be>VOC regulates the inverter output power by emulating the nonlinear dynamics of a Van der Pol oscillator. Similar to the classic droop control methods, VOC allows power sharing among parallel inverters. However, unlike droop control methods, VOC proves to provide better performance. VOC is a time-domain controller that regulates the power flow based on the instantaneous current measurement only with no additional low pass filters. Hence, it provides a faster response during demand changes and transients compared to the droop control.
