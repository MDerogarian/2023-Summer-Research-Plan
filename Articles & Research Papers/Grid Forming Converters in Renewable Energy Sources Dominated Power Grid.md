<be>With the increasing penetration of converter-interfaced RESs, the conventional synchronous generator (SG) dominated power grid is being changed to a weak power grid with low inertia. Under this condition, a small perturbation will cause large fluctuation and deviation of grid frequency, resulting in low-frequency demand disconnection and even the collapse of the power grid.
