Li, Yitong, Yunjie Gu, and Timothy C. Green. "Revisiting grid-forming and grid-following inverters: A duality theory." IEEE Transactions on Power Systems 37.6 (2022): 4541-4554.

<br>Analysis shows that the grid-forming and grid-following inverters are duals of each other in several ways including: 
- a) synchronization controllers: frequency droop control and phase-locked loop (PLL); 
- b) grid-interfacing characteristics: current-following voltage-forming and voltage-following current-forming; 
- c) swing characteristics: current-angle swing and voltage-angle swing; 
- d) inner-loop controllers: output impedance shaping and output admittance shaping;
- e) grid strength compatibility: strong-grid instability and weak-grid instability.
