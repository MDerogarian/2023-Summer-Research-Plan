 <br>Many of these new resources are connected to the power system through power electronic inverters rather than spinning electromechanical machines. Collectively, we refer to these generation technologies as inverter-based resources.
A workshop has been held at the University of Washington the related [Link](https://lowinertiagrids.ece.uw.edu/) is here, the videos of the workshop are available in YouTube as well.
