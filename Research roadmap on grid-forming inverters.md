<br>Many of these new resources are connected to the power system through power electronic inverters rather than spinning electromechanical machines. Collectively, we refer to these generation technologies as inverter-based resources.

<br>Synchronous generators regulate their terminal voltages and respond to a change in grid frequency through a change in its power output; these are traditionally referred to as generator excitation and turbine-governor controls, respectively. These types of primary, secondary, and tertiary controls and voltage control are well-known. We refer to these generation sources as grid-forming. 

<br> Todayâ€™s inverter-based generation sources generally use phase-locked loops (PLLs), which rely on externally generated voltages by synchronous machines to operate. We refer to these types of inverter-based generation as grid-following inverters.
