In this repo, I will share important information from my research on grid-forming or grid-connected Power Electronic converters.  
For each article or paper I read, I will add a README file with its name on it; so you easily find the PDF file on the Internet; moreover, I will add some useful text and any picture or control loop I think is necessary.
